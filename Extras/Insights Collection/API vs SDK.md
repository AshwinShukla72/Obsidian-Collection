# WHAT IS API?
##### API stands for Application Prgramming Interface, it's an abstraction for the underlying implementation.
##### It is a type of interface offering service to other parts of system.


# WHAT IS SDK?
##### SDK stands for Software Development Kit, it is a collection of software development tools in one intallable package.
##### They facilitate the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger and sometimes a software framework. They are normally specific to a hardware platform and operating system.

# DIFFERENCE B/T API and SDK

| **API**                                                                                                | **SDK**                                                                                                                                     |

| They are a set of definitons and protocols to talk to other apps & services and a act as bridge        | Collection of software tools which call APIs                                                                                                |
| APIs are standardised and have are of different specifications                                         | SDKs are built to work with specific languages and support applications to call APIs, reducing complexity of sendinf requests from the user |
| To define an API request you need Operation + Param + Endpoint and it request should return a response | SDK uses utility classes to call said API                                                                                                   |
| APIs are built to interact with services                                                               | SDKs are designed to build entire applications and the interactions the application can provide                                                                                                                                            |

# SIMILARITIES
##### APIs and SDKs are about communcation between services or components
##### APIs and SDK abstract most of the information on how the method or service is being implemented
