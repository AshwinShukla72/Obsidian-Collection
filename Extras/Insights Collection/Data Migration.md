#### What is data migration
**Data** #migration **is** the process of moving **data** from one location to another, one format to another, or one application to another.

##### What are the phases of data migration

|                | Pre-Migration                                                                               | Migration                                                        | Post-Migration                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key-Activities** | Assess, cleanse, Extract, transform and Load                                                | Prepare Reports & metrics, verify records count & fix exceptions | Complete documentation, generate quality report & system report |
| **Output**         | Scope and strategy documentation, cleaned source data & ETL jobs and data migration scripts | Signed off migration document                                    | Signed off data migration clousre document                                                                |

##### What are ETL jobs?
==ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load==, The job/procedure for copying data from one or more sources, then transforming the data at the source system, and lastly copying into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source(s).


##### Data Migration Types
1. Storage Migration
2. Data centre Migration
3. Application Migration
4. Database Migration
5. Business Process Migration
6. Data Migration to cloud


##### What are the tests for a successful data migration?
1. Design strategy
2. Data source analysis
3. Build a migration solution
4. Data Cleansing
5. Data validation
6. Sort Data
7. Migrate Data
8. Conduct Live Test

##### Types of Database Migrations

| 'Big Bang' Migration                                     | 'Trickle' Migration                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Full Transfer is complete in a window time (server Down) | Completes the migration process in stages |
| Less Costly                                              | Very Costly                               |
| If migration fails, rollback is required                 | Rollback is not required                  |
| Risk of expensive failure is high                        | Risk of expensice failure is low          |

##### Risks involved in Data Migration
- Long transfer Times
- Data loss
- Security
- Unexpected Higher Costs
- Compatibility
- Long Transfer times
