> The JavaScript language is transitioning from being a single-threaded language to being a multithreaded language. The Atomics object, for example, provides mechanisms to coordinate communication across different threads, while instances of ==SharedArrayBuffer== can be written to and read from across threads. That said, as of this writing, multithreaded JavaScript still hasn’t caught on within the community. ==JavaScript today is multithreaded==, but it’s still the nature of the language, and of the ecosystem, to be single-threaded.
