#### Scalability
- The capability of a system to grow and manage increased demand, the system that can continuously evolve to support growing amount of work is scalable 
- **Horizontal Scaling** Add more servers into the pool of resources
- **Vertical Scaling** Add more resources to the same server, can usually cost downtime and server limit

#### Reliability

- The Probability that a system will fail in a given period
- A distributed system is reliable if it keeps on delivering service even when one or multiple services fail
- Reliability is achieved through redundancy of components and data.

#### Efficiency
- **Latency**: response time, the delay to obtain the first piece of data.
- **Bandwidth**: throughput, amount of data delivered in a given time.

#### Serviceability / Manageability
- Easiness to operate and maintain the system.
- Simplicity and spend with which a system can be repaired or maintained.
