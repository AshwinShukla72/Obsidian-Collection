**Consistent hashing** is a distributed hashing technique used in computer science and distributed systems.

Consistent hashing plays a crucial role in achieving load balancing and distributing requests effectively.

1. *Hashing for Load Balancing:*
    - **Hashing** is a technique used to distribute traffic across servers in a distributed environment.
    - When a request comes in, a hash function calculates a value based on the request identifier (e.g., user ID or URL).
    - The result is then taken modulo the number of active servers (nodes) to determine which server should handle the request.
    - This ensures uniform distribution of requests, achieving load balancing.

1. *Consistent Hashing:*
    
    - Consistent hashing distributes keys (requests) across a ring-like structure.
    - Each server/node is represented on this ring.
    - When a request arrives, its hash determines the position on the ring.
    - The request is then assigned to the nearest server in a clockwise direction.
    - Replicas of servers (virtual nodes) handle load distribution and fault tolerance.
    - If a server fails, its replicas take over the load seamlessly.

How do you handle data consistency in a microservices architecture?
```
```ad-faq
Maintaining *data consistency* in a *microservices architecture* can be challenging due to the distributed nature of services and their independent data stores. Here are some techniques to address this:

1. **Saga Pattern**:
    
    - The **Saga Pattern** coordinates multiple transactions across microservices.
    - Each business operation spanning services consists of individual transactions.
    - The key idea is to allow rollback by invoking a **compensation action** (e.g., a “Cancel” operation).
    - Make services **idempotent** to handle retries or restarts in case of failures.
2. **Eventual Consistency**:
    
    - Embrace **eventual consistency** where possible.
    - Understand scenarios where strong consistency (ACID transactions) is necessary and where eventual consistency is acceptable.
    - Monitor failures proactively and react accordingly.
3. **Trade-offs**:
    
    - In high-scale applications, avoid using the **two-phase commit (2PC)** pattern due to its limitations.
    - Instead, consider #BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) trade-offs.
    - Engineers need to handle consistency manually based on specific requirements.

Remember, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, but these approaches help manage data consistency effectively in microservices.
