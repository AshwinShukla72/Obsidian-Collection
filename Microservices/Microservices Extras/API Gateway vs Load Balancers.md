API Gateways and Load Balancers are both used in distributed systems, but they serve different purposes. 

*An API Gateway acts as a single entry point into a system*, handling tasks like authentication, request transformation, and validation. It's aware of the system's internal structure and routes requests to appropriate services. On the other hand, *a Load Balancer is primarily used to distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed*. _It's not aware of the internal structure of the system and doesn't perform request transformation or validation_. 


In summary, while both tools help manage traffic, an API Gateway is more about managing and enhancing the API requests and responses, while a Load Balancer is about distributing network traffic for efficiency and reliability.
