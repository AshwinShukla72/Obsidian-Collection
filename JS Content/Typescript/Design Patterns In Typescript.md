- Pillars Of OOP ->
	- Abstraction
	- Encapsulation
	- Inheritance
	- Polymorphism



### Design Patterns

```ad-faq
Pattern are often confused with alogithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. 

While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level descrip- tion of a solution.
```

```ad-info
As compared to recipes:
- Algorithms have a clear steps to create the dish
- Pattern emphasize a blueprint meaning the content, features and the result are present but the exact order of implementation is up to the user
```

```ad-info
A pattern mostly has 4 key informations
- Intent: Describes both the problem and the solution
- Motivation: Describes the problem in detail and pattern makes possible
- Structure: The structure of Classes shows each part of the pattern and how the are related. 
- Code Example: Example in the selected programming language
```

```ad-important
all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. This book covers three main groups of patterns: 
• *Creational patterns* provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. 
• *Structural patterns* explain how to assemble objects and class- es into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient. 
• *Behavioral patterns* take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
