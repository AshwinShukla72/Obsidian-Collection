- JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are primarily used for verifying user identity in authentication, not for authorization.
- JWTs consist of a Header, Payload, and Signature, allowing for decentralized verification using JWKs (JSON Web Keys).
- OAuth, which uses JWTs, is the de facto standard for authentication, involving multiple types of tokens like ID and access tokens.
- JWTs should be used for verification and as a source of truth for user identity and profile.
- JWTs are static in nature, making them unsuitable for dynamic authorization models like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- JWTs have a size limit, making it difficult to store enough data for complex authorization models like Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)
