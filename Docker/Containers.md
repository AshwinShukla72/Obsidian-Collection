## Docker Container

> A docker Container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that contains everything needed to run an application.

- #### Introductory points
	- Run images with the Local Device Kernels
	- Containers are writable unlike Docker images.
	- When `docker run IMAGE_NAME` is run if said image is not found locally then, an image is automatically pulled form docker #Registry.
	- #Registry is a system that stores images.
	- ==Generally Only one service is executable in one container?==
